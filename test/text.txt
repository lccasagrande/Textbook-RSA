We demonstrate inheritance in a very simple example. We create a Person class with the two attributes "firstname" and "lastname". This class has only one method, the Name method, essentially a getter, but we don't have an attribute name. This method is a further example for a "getter", which creates an output by creating it from more than one private attribute. Name returns the concatenation of the first name and the last name of a person, separated by a space. It goes without saying that a useful person class would have additional attributes and further methods.
